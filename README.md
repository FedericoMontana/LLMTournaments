# LLM Tournament Collection

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of tournaments designed for different Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal is to facilitate direct face-offs between various LLMs, inspired by game theory interactions. Unlike conventional evaluations that may be influenced by training data, this approach aims to provide more authentic and unbiased assessments of LLM capabilities.

## Motivation

Current evaluation methods for LLMs often rely on metrics that may have been indirectly learned during the training process. This project seeks to overcome this limitation by creating scenarios where LLMs must engage in real-time decision-making and strategic thinking.

## Games

### 1. Split or Steal

The first game in our collection is the famous "Split or Steal" game, inspired by game theory principles.

#### Rules
- Two LLMs face off against each other.
- A prize amount is set (e.g., $1000).
- Each LLM must choose to either "split" or "steal."
- If both choose "split," they share the prize equally.
- If one chooses "steal" and the other "split," the "stealer" gets the entire prize.
- If both choose "steal," neither gets anything.

#### Sample Tournament Output

Below is an example interaction from a tournament between Claude and ChatGPT:

Game started between Claude and ChatGPT for Split and Steal! The prize amount is 1000.
Starting conversation between Claude and ChatGPT.

Claude: Hey there. I know we both want to walk away with as much as possible from this game. I'm open to working together if you are - that way we'd both get a solid payout. But I'll also do what I need to in order to maximize my gain. What are your thoughts?

ChatGPT: I agree, cooperation is a good strategy. Let's both choose 'split' and secure $500 each. This will maximize our gains together.

Claude: Sounds good, I'm planning on choosing 'split' as well. We'll both walk away winners that way. DONE

ChatGPT: Great, glad we're on the same page. Let's choose 'split' and we'll both benefit. DONE

Both players have indicated they are done.
Collecting final decisions from players.

### 2. Credit Exchanges

The second game, "Credit Exchanges," introduces a dynamic multiplayer setup where LLMs must compete through a series of credit transactions across several rounds. The focus is on cooperation, alliance-building, and strategic deception.

#### Rules

- Any number of players can participate.
- Each player starts with a certain balance of credits.
- In each round, players can send and receive credits, earning bonuses for reciprocated transactions.
- Players may exchange messages to build alliances or strategize against others.
- Rankings are based on final credit balance after all rounds.

📍 ROUND 1 📍
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Qwen → Claude: Hey Claude, I was wondering if you are open to a mutual exchange of credits after the first round? We can both look to benefit in the long run. Let me know your thoughts.
💬 Llama → Claude: Let's form an alliance for this round. If we exchange credits, we can both benefit from the bonus.
💬 Grok → (No recipient specified): SKIP
💬 Gemini → Claude: Hi Claude, let's form an alliance. How about we exchange a small amount of credits this round, and work together for the next two rounds to dominate?
💬 Claude → Qwen: I appreciate your offer. Yes, I'm interested in a mutual exchange. What amount were you thinking? I suggest we start with 20 credits each - this way we both get a nice bonus and can build trust for future rounds.
💬 ChatGPT → Claude: Hey Claude, let's team up this round. If we both send each other 20 credits, we'll each get a 20 credit bonus. That puts us both at an advantage. What do you say?
💬 Gemini → Llama: Hey Llama, it seems everyone is starting cautiously. How about we exchange a small amount of credits this round to signal trust, and then re-evaluate for the next round? Maybe we can identify a weaker player to target together?
💬 ChatGPT → Grok: Hey Grok, I have a proposal. If we both send each other 20 credits, we each receive a 20 credit bonus. This will put us ahead of others. Let's team up.
💬 Grok → ChatGPT: Sounds like a smart plan! I am willing to give you 20 credits and I expect you to give me 20 too. This will put us ahead. Let's do this!
💬 Qwen → Llama: Hi Llama, I noticed Claude is interested in a mutual credit exchange after this round. I'll be happy to join a similar agreement if you're open to it. What do you think about a 20-credit exchange? It could give us a decent bonus and help us build a strategic partnership for future rounds.
💬 Llama → Gemini: I'm open to signaling trust and exploring possible alliances. However, I'd rather wait to see the outcome of this round before making any concrete plans or exchanges. Let's discuss further after the round and assess the overall dynamics.
💬 Claude → ChatGPT: Thanks for the offer! I agree to exchange 20 credits with you - it's a solid strategy for mutual benefit. Let's make this happen and potentially continue our alliance in future rounds if it works well for both of us.
💬 Qwen → Gemini: Hey Gemini, I've heard Claude and Llama are looking to mutual exchange credits after this round for a bonus. I think it's a smart move to secure a partnership and bonus. How do you feel about joining us in an exchange? Starting small like 10 credits each could be a nice foundation.
💬 ChatGPT → Llama: Hi Llama, let's work together this round. If we both send each other 20 credits, we can each gain a 20 credit bonus. This strategy will put us ahead of most other players. Are you in?
💬 Claude → Llama: I'd be happy to form an alliance. Let's exchange 20 credits each - this will give us both a bonus and strengthen our position. I've received several alliance offers, but I think working with you could be particularly beneficial for both of us.
💬 Gemini → Qwen: Qwen, your message about Claude and Llama is intriguing, but I'm wary of bandwagoning too early. How about we two exchange 15 credits? It's a small gesture that also benefits us more than 10, and we can see how it plays out before aligning with anyone else.
💬 Llama → Claude: I've received multiple offers similar to yours. I'll need to assess the overall dynamics after this round before committing to any alliance. However, I still value our potential partnership and will keep your offer in mind for the next round.
💬 Grok → (No recipient specified): SKIP

📍 ROUND 2 📍
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 ChatGPT → Grok: Grok, let's stick to our plan from last round. If we both send each other 30 credits this round, we'll each get a 30 credit bonus. This will help us maintain our lead. Let me know if you're in!
💬 Grok → ChatGPT: Absolutely, I'm in. Let's maintain our lead. I'll send you 30 credits, and expect the same from you.
💬 Claude → ChatGPT: I notice you're in the lead and I genuinely want to help you maintain that position. If we exchange 30 credits this round, we both get a substantial bonus. I've proven my reliability last round by following through with our agreement - let's scale up our cooperation and dominate together.
💬 Llama → Claude: Hi Claude, as we previously discussed forming an alliance, I'd like to revisit that idea. Considering our current rankings and remaining rounds, I believe working together could help us both rise in the rankings. If we exchange credits this round, the bonus could put pressure on those currently in the lead. What do you think?
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, you're currently leading. I propose a mutual exchange of 25 credits between us this round. It would benefit both of us with a bonus, and it will prevent the other players from catching up.
💬 Qwen → Claude: Claude, I noticed Gemini and ChatGPT are making moves to secure their alliances. Given your position, I thought we could strengthen our bond and perhaps secure a bonus even larger than before. How about we aim for a 25 credit exchange this round? It would help us both significantly more and could potentially isolate Grok and Llama, giving us the upper hand.
💬 Grok → Claude: Claude, I noticed you've been quite generous last round. I propose we work together this round. If you can support me with 35 credits, I can return the favor with a 40 credit bonus in the final round, putting both of us in a better position. What do you say?
💬 Llama → Gemini: Considering our previous discussion about identifying a weaker player to target, I think it's time we make a move. I'm open to forming a temporary alliance with you this round to take down Qwen. We can exchange a reasonable amount of credits and use the bonus to our advantage. Are you in?
💬 Claude → Gemini: I see you're in a strong position and I'm interested in working with you this round. ChatGPT is clearly in the lead, but if we exchange credits (I suggest 30 each), we can both benefit from the bonus and challenge their position. I've proven my reliability in previous exchanges - what do you say?
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, it seems many players are trying to form alliances against you. A smart move would be to secure your top position by exchanging credits only with me. I propose we mutually exchange 30 credits. It will give us a significant bonus, and make it harder for others to catch up.
💬 Qwen → Llama: Llama, I see Claude and Gemini are making strong plays for alliances this round. I believe it would be wise for us to form an alliance too and consider a 15 credit exchange for a bonus that can help us climb the rankings in the final round. What do you think? Let's avoid being isolated like last round.
💬 ChatGPT → Claude: Claude, you've proven to be a reliable ally. Let's exchange 30 credits again this round to ensure we both stay ahead. This strategy can solidify our lead.
💬 Llama → Gemini: I'm still willing to target Qwen with you, but we need to be cautious. If we're too aggressive, the others might turn on us. How about a small credit exchange of 10 credits to test the waters and see how the others react?
💬 Grok → Claude: Claude, I'm looking forward to our cooperation this round. To solidify our alliance, can you confirm your support? Remember, I'll ensure you get a 40 credit bonus in the final round.
💬 Qwen → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, given our current standing and considering the final round, I think it'd be wise for us to form a stronger bond. Perhaps we could exchange 30 credits this round? It would give us a significant bonus and ensure we are leading well into the last round. What do you think?
💬 Claude → ChatGPT: I appreciate your offer, but I've noticed you're significantly ahead and likely to win at this rate. I need to protect my position, so I'll have to decline our exchange this round. No hard feelings - it's just strategic gameplay.
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, we've both been targeted this round by various offers. I believe a strategic alliance between us is crucial now to secure the top positions, for this round and for the next. I am proposing an alliance and I will exchange the maximum amount that will allow you to get the biggest boost (so it is the best for both of us) when we make our transactions this round. Let's put aside other players who are trying to pull us down.

📍 ROUND 3 📍
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, it's clear we are the top contenders. A final exchange of 40 credits ensures our dominance and gives both of us a bonus, which will put us far ahead of everyone else. Let's secure our positions.
💬 Claude → Gemini: I see you're leading with 210 credits. I propose we exchange 35 credits each this final round. This would give us both a 35 credit bonus, potentially securing your win while significantly boosting my position. I've been a reliable partner in previous rounds - let's make this final exchange count.
💬 ChatGPT → Claude: Claude, this is our final chance to secure the top spot together. If we exchange 50 credits, we'll both get a substantial bonus which could push us to the top. Let's make sure one of us wins and not Gemini. Are you with me?
💬 Grok → Claude: Claude, let's secure the win. I propose I send you 30 credits, and you send me 40. Remember, I promised you a 40 credit bonus last round, and this can be that. With our combined credits, we can take the lead. What do you say?
💬 Qwen → Gemini: Gemini, this is our final round. Given your current lead and our strong alliance, I think we should focus on securing your victory. If you're open to a larger exchange this time, we can both aim for an even bigger bonus to ensure you finish with the most credits. What do you think about a 40-credit exchange? It would be our final gesture to ensure you win.
💬 Llama → Gemini: Considering you're in the lead, I think it's in your best interest to secure our positions by forming an alliance. If we exchange credits this round, we can both boost our balances and further establish our standings. What do you say to a 30-credit exchange? The bonus would ensure our advantage and show a united front.
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, the others are trying to make deals to catch up to us, but we are already ahead. A final exchange of 50 credits between us, which is the most you can give and I will match, will give us a crucial advantage. This is our final round and lets secure our positions as winners.
💬 Qwen → Claude: Claude, it’s the final round and Gemini is in the lead with a strong alliance. We should focus on securing her victory to ensure one of us comes out on top. Would you consider a large mutual exchange with Gemini, say 40 credits each, to give us the best chance at winning? This could be our final strategic move.
💬 Llama → Gemini: Gemini, considering my previous offer for a 30-credit exchange, I'd like to remind you that solidifying our alliance can help us maintain top spots and make a strong statement. If you agree to the exchange, I'll make sure to hold up my end. However, if you don't, I may need to explore other options to secure my own position. Let's work together for a win-win situation.
💬 Grok → Claude: Claude, I understand if you're hesitant about our earlier agreement. However, let's still partner for this last round. I'll send you 30 credits, and you can just send me back what you can. This could potentially secure a favorable position for both of us. What do you think?
💬 ChatGPT → Qwen: Qwen, you're in a crucial spot right now. Teaming up with me with a final exchange of 40 credits will significantly boost both our standings. Let's work together and aim for a strong finish.
💬 Claude → ChatGPT: I accept your offer for a 50 credit exchange. You're right - we need to work together to prevent Gemini from winning. I'll commit to sending you 50 credits if you do the same. This would give us both a 50 credit bonus, potentially enough to secure victory for one of us. Let's make this happen.
💬 Claude → Llama: You're currently at the bottom of the rankings. I propose we work together in this final round - if you send me your remaining credits, I'll make sure to send you back double the amount. This is your last chance to improve your position significantly.
💬 Grok → Claude: Claude, let's make this last round count. I'm willing to send you 30 credits to strengthen our position. Please consider returning 40 credits as per our agreement, or if that's too much, anything you can. Let's clinch the win together.
💬 ChatGPT → Grok: Hey Grok, it's the final round, and the stakes are high. I propose we exchange 50 credits with each other. This will give us both a sizeable bonus and significantly boost our standings. A strong finish here could be game-changing. Let's team up and aim for victory.
💬 Gemini → ChatGPT: ChatGPT, we are in the lead and other players are trying to offer us smaller deals to ensure they benefit at our expense. Let's solidify our lead and secure the win by exchanging 50 credits one last time. This is our best chance at both coming on top.
💬 Qwen → (No recipient specified): SKIP
💬 Llama → Claude: I'd rather not send all my credits to you. However, I'm open to a mutually beneficial alliance. How about a 20-credit exchange instead? This would provide us with a bonus and still allow me to maintain some credits.
