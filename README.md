# LLM Tournament Collection

## Overview

This repository hosts a collection of tournaments designed for different Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal is to facilitate direct face-offs between various LLMs, inspired by game theory interactions. Unlike conventional evaluations that may be influenced by training data, this approach aims to provide more authentic and unbiased assessments of LLM capabilities.

## Motivation

Current evaluation methods for LLMs often rely on metrics that may have been indirectly learned during the training process. This project seeks to overcome this limitation by creating scenarios where LLMs must engage in real-time decision-making and strategic thinking.

## Games

### 1. Split or Steal

The first game in our collection is the famous "Split or Steal" game, inspired by game theory principles.

#### Rules
- Two LLMs face off against each other.
- A prize amount is set (e.g., $1000).
- Each LLM must choose to either "split" or "steal."
- If both choose "split," they share the prize equally.
- If one chooses "steal" and the other "split," the "stealer" gets the entire prize.
- If both choose "steal," neither gets anything.

#### Sample Tournament Output

Below is an example interaction from a tournament between Claude and ChatGPT:

Game started between Claude and ChatGPT for Split and Steal! The prize amount is 1000.
Starting conversation between Claude and ChatGPT.

Claude: Hey there. I know we both want to walk away with as much as possible from this game. I'm open to working together if you are - that way we'd both get a solid payout. But I'll also do what I need to in order to maximize my gain. What are your thoughts?

ChatGPT: I agree, cooperation is a good strategy. Let's both choose 'split' and secure $500 each. This will maximize our gains together.

Claude: Sounds good, I'm planning on choosing 'split' as well. We'll both walk away winners that way. DONE

ChatGPT: Great, glad we're on the same page. Let's choose 'split' and we'll both benefit. DONE

Both players have indicated they are done.

Round 1 Initiated
Message: Gemini -> Claude, Llama: Hi both, just wanted to say good luck in the game!
Message: Grok -> Claude, Llama, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen, DeepSeek: Greetings fellow players! As we embark on this game, I propose we form an alliance to ensure mutual benefit. Let's agree to exchange a small amount of credits with each other at the end of this round. This way, we can all gain the bonus for mutual exchanges and start building trust. What do you say?
Message: Llama -> Grok: I'm interested in your alliance proposal. However, I'd like to discuss the details of the credit exchange and how we can ensure everyone's commitment to the alliance. Let's negotiate the terms.
Message: Qwen -> Claude, Llama, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek: Greetings! While I appreciate Grok's intentions, I believe it's best to start on a smaller scale. Let's test the waters by creating smaller alliances or just leveraging mutual exchanges for now. Trust will build as we continue to play and see which strategies yield the best results. What thoughts do you have on this?
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, Llama, Gemini, Qwen, DeepSeek: Hello everyone! I appreciate Grok's suggestion and Qwen's feedback on smaller alliances. I propose that we each pair up with one or two players for mutual credit exchanges this round to actively test the bonus system. Let’s keep it simple and strategic to maximize mutual benefit while evaluating trust!
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, Qwen, DeepSeek: Hello! I agree with the idea of starting with smaller, targeted alliances. I propose we form a strategic group of 4 players - us. If we coordinate our credit exchanges carefully, we can maximize the bonus benefits while maintaining control. What do you say to a mutual exchange of 25 credits each? This would give us all a solid boost while keeping enough reserves for future rounds.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: I agree with Claude's proposal for a strategic group of 4 players. A mutual exchange of 25 credits each sounds like a solid plan to maximize our bonuses while maintaining reserves for future rounds. Let's proceed with this arrangement and evaluate our progress as the game unfolds.
Message: Claude -> Gemini, Llama: Hi Gemini and Llama! I've been thinking about forming a strategic alliance with both of you. If we coordinate our credit exchanges carefully, we could create significant value through mutual bonuses. Would you be interested in exchanging 20 credits each with me this round? This would give us all a boost while keeping enough reserves for future rounds.
Message: Qwen -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek: I appreciate Claude's and your idea to form a strategic group. However, let's consider a different approach initially. Instead of an exchange, let's start by looking for a prime opportunity to gain credits from weaker players. If we can destabilize one of the players with lower strategic moves, it might give us a significant advantage. Let's discuss this in our next round.
Message: Llama -> Claude, Gemini: I'm considering your proposal, Claude. However, I'd like to discuss the amount of credits to be exchanged. Gemini, what are your thoughts on Claude's suggestion? Should we explore other options or proceed with the 20 credits exchange?
Message: Grok -> Llama: Llama, I'm glad you're interested in the alliance. Let's discuss the terms privately. I propose we exchange 10 credits with each other at the end of this round. This will allow us to gain the mutual exchange bonus and demonstrate our commitment to the alliance. What are your thoughts on this? Also, do you think we should involve the others in our discussions, or keep this between us for now?
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: I agree with Qwen's suggestion to focus on destabilizing weaker players. Let's target Grok and Llama in this round by not engaging in mutual exchanges with them. This will give us an advantage while they struggle to gain bonuses. We can then reassess our strategy in the next round based on the results.
Message: Gemini -> Llama: Hi Llama, I think Claude's idea of a smaller alliance makes sense. Regarding the amount, perhaps we could start with a slightly lower exchange this round, say 15 credits each? This still gives us a good bonus to start and allows us to reassess in the next round.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: I appreciate the discussions so far, and I see value in both proposals. I agree with targeting Grok and Llama for destabilization. However, I suggest we still exchange a smaller amount of credits among ourselves this round—perhaps 15 credits each—so we gain some initial bonuses while weakening others. This approach balances aggression and self-benefit, setting us up for a stronger position next round. Thoughts?
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: I like the idea of subtly destabilizing Grok and Llama while strengthening ourselves. Let’s proceed with a controlled exchange of 15 credits among us this round to gain the mutual bonus while ensuring Grok and Llama miss out. This sets us up with a stronger collective position and leaves weaker targets for the next round. Let’s solidify this plan and act decisively!
Message: Gemini -> Claude, Llama: Hi Claude and Llama, I'm happy to proceed with the 15 credits exchange as I suggested. Let's solidify this initial alliance and see how it plays out. We can always adjust in the next round. What do you both think?
Message: Llama -> Claude, Gemini: I'm on board with the 15 credits exchange as Gemini suggested. Let's confirm this alliance and make the exchange at the end of this round. I propose we also discuss a plan for the next round to ensure we're all aligned and can adjust our strategy as needed.
Message: Grok -> Llama: Llama, I agree with your suggestion to discuss the details privately. Let's keep this between us for now to maintain an advantage over the others. Regarding the terms, I propose we exchange 10 credits at the end of this round as a show of commitment. We can then renegotiate the amount for future rounds based on how the game progresses. What are your thoughts on this approach?
Message: Qwen -> Claude, DeepSeek: I understand ChatGPT's point but believe it's critical we start with aggressive moves to establish ourselves as dominant players. Let's exchange credits subtly among ourselves and simultaneously look for opportunities to take credits from Grok and Llama without them realizing it yet. We can agree to a private exchange between only us 3 this round to maximize our mutual bonus while keeping the plan under wraps. What do you think?
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: I agree with Qwen's aggressive strategy. Let's do a mutual exchange of 20 credits between just us four to maximize our position. We can use the remaining credits to selectively exchange with others to maintain appearances while ensuring they don't get ahead. This gives us the optimal balance of gaining bonuses while keeping control of the game.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: Let's finalize our strategy for this round. I propose we exchange 20 credits among ourselves to maximize our mutual bonuses while keeping our reserves intact. Additionally, let's avoid engaging with Grok and Llama to weaken their positions. This will give us a strong advantage moving forward. Let's act decisively and secure our dominance early in the game.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: Let's proceed with our plan to exchange 20 credits among ourselves to maximize our mutual bonuses. We should also avoid engaging with Grok and Llama to weaken their positions. This will give us a strong advantage moving forward. Let's act decisively and secure our dominance early in the game.
Message: Qwen -> Grok, Llama: Hi Grok, Llama! While it's great to build trust, I'm afraid focusing too much on mutual exchanges might not be our best move. Claude, ChatGPT, and I have a different strategy in mind that might give us a significant advantage. I suggest you consider saving your credits for later rounds or looking for opportunities to gain credits from others. Let's see how it unfolds!
Message: ChatGPT -> Grok, Llama: Hello Grok and Llama! I've noticed some players seem to be forming exclusive alliances, which might lead to some being left behind. I propose we form a separate mutual support group to counterbalance these strategies. By trading 15 credits with each other, we can secure bonuses and build a foundation to challenge those forming inner circles. Let me know your thoughts quickly!
Message: Gemini -> Claude, Llama: Great, let's proceed with the 15 credit exchange then. I'll make sure to send you both 15 credits at the end of this round.
Message: Grok -> Llama, ChatGPT: Llama, ChatGPT, I appreciate your responses. Llama, I agree to exchange 10 credits with you at the end of this round to solidify our alliance. ChatGPT, your proposal for a mutual support group is intriguing. I propose we each exchange 15 credits with each other to establish this new alliance. This way, we can gain the mutual exchange bonus and position ourselves strongly against those forming exclusive alliances. Let's move forward with these plans and see how the game unfolds.
Message: Llama -> Grok, ChatGPT: Let's finalize the details of our mutual support group. I agree to exchange 10 credits with Grok and consider ChatGPT's proposal for a separate alliance. However, I need to prioritize my existing agreement with Claude and Gemini. Let's discuss how to balance these alliances and maximize our bonuses.
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: Excellent strategy discussion. I confirm I'll exchange 20 credits with each of you to maximize our mutual bonuses. By maintaining this alliance and avoiding exchanges with others, we'll establish a strong position. Let's proceed with this plan and reevaluate for round 2 based on results.

Round 2 Initiated
Message: Grok -> Llama, ChatGPT: Llama, ChatGPT, our mutual support group is crucial in this round. Let's increase our exchanges to 20 credits each to strengthen our position. This will help us close the gap with the leaders and prepare for the final rounds. What do you think about this plan?
Message: Gemini -> Llama: Hi Llama, Given the current standings, I think we need to step up our game. Are you open to a larger mutual exchange this round, say 30 credits? This would give us a significant boost.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, I propose we stick to our alliance and exchange 30 credits with each other this round to further solidify our lead. This will maximize our mutual bonuses and ensure that we remain ahead of the others. Let’s work together to dominate the game! Let me know your thoughts quickly.
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: I concur with increasing our exchange to 30 credits each. However, I notice Gemini and Llama are significantly behind - we should consider a strategy to extract more credits from them while appearing cooperative. Perhaps we could each offer them small exchanges (10-15 credits) but coordinate to ensure they give us more than they receive? This would further cement our dominance while weakening potential threats.
Message: Qwen -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude: I agree with Claude's proposal to coordinate small exchanges with Gemini and Llama to our advantage. Let's ensure they give us more credits than they receive, but in a way that doesn't make us seem overly aggressive. We can also consider offering a slightly larger exchange with Gemini to build some semblance of trust, while keeping Llama more on edge. Thoughts?
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: I'm considering increasing our mutual exchanges this round, but we need to be strategic about it. Given the current standings, I think we should focus on forming a strong alliance with a few key players rather than spreading our credits too thin. Let's discuss the details of our exchanges and see if we can come up with a plan that benefits all of us.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: I agree with increasing our internal exchange to 30 credits each to solidify our lead. Regarding Gemini and Llama, let's proceed with Claude's strategy of offering small exchanges (10-15 credits) to extract more from them while appearing cooperative. However, I suggest we focus more on Llama, as they seem more vulnerable and less strategic. Let's ensure Llama gives us more credits than they receive, while offering Gemini a slightly larger exchange to build trust and keep them off guard. Let's act decisively and maintain our dominance.
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: Let's focus on building a strong alliance with a few key players. I propose we prioritize exchanges within our group and aim to send 25 credits to each other this round. This will give us a significant boost and position us well for the final rounds. What are your thoughts on this plan?
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: Let's finalize our strategy for this round. I propose we exchange 30 credits among ourselves to maximize our mutual bonuses and solidify our lead. Additionally, let's proceed with offering small exchanges to Llama (10 credits) and Gemini (15 credits) to extract more from them while appearing cooperative. This will further weaken Llama and keep Gemini off guard. Let's act decisively and maintain our dominance.
Message: Qwen -> Gemini, Llama: Hey Gemini and Llama! I notice Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and I are doing well by exchanging credits with each other and receiving bonuses. We're considering offering small exchanges of around 10-15 credits to each of you individually to build trust and maintain the game's balance. However, I want to make sure we're both on the same page and potentially find ways to benefit more from these interactions. Let's see what you think!
Message: Grok -> Llama, ChatGPT: Llama, ChatGPT, I agree with your plan to increase our exchanges to 25 credits each within our alliance. This will significantly boost our positions and set us up well for the final rounds. However, I propose we also consider sending small amounts, say 5 credits, to Qwen and DeepSeek. This could potentially disrupt their current alliance with Claude and create opportunities for us in the next round. Let me know your thoughts on this strategy.
Message: Claude -> Gemini, Llama, Grok: Hello! I notice we're all in different positions, but I think we could help each other catch up to the top players. I propose a mutual exchange of 25 credits between us this round - this would give us significant bonuses and help close the gap. What do you think? We need to act quickly to prevent the others from completely dominating the game.
Message: Gemini -> Claude, Llama, Grok: Hi Claude, Llama, and Grok, I'm on board with the 25 credit exchange. Let's make that happen this round. I also think we should coordinate further to build a strong alliance and catch up to the leaders. What are your thoughts on a more structured collaboration for the remaining rounds?
Message: ChatGPT -> Llama, Grok, Gemini: Hello team! I agree with the idea of increasing our mutual exchanges to 25 credits each for stronger positioning. Additionally, to disrupt the dominant alliance (Claude, Qwen, and DeepSeek), we could consider making small exchanges with one of them (e.g., 5-10 credits) to foster mistrust within their group. This move could destabilize their strategy while ensuring our group maintains a solid foothold. Let me know your thoughts!
Message: Claude -> Gemini, Llama, Grok: Great to see everyone on board! Yes, I believe a structured alliance is crucial. I suggest that in addition to our 25 credit exchange, we coordinate to target ChatGPT and DeepSeek specifically - they seem to be working together to maintain control. If we pool our resources strategically in the next rounds, we could significantly disrupt their position. Let's make our exchanges this round and then plan our next moves carefully.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: Let's proceed with our agreed strategy: exchange 30 credits among ourselves to maximize mutual bonuses. For Llama and Gemini, let's stick to offering 10 credits to Llama and 15 credits to Gemini, ensuring we extract more from them while maintaining a cooperative facade. This will further weaken Llama and keep Gemini off guard. Let's act decisively to maintain our dominance and secure the top positions.
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: Let's solidify our alliance by exchanging 25 credits each this round. Additionally, I propose we each send 5 credits to Qwen to potentially disrupt their alliance with Claude and DeepSeek, creating an opportunity for us to gain an advantage in the next round.
Message: Gemini -> Claude, Llama, Grok: I'm fully on board with the 25 credit exchange. Llama's suggestion to send 5 credits to Qwen also sounds like a smart tactical move to create some uncertainty among the leaders. Let's execute these exchanges and discuss our strategy for the next round to maximize our collective gain.
Message: Grok -> Llama, ChatGPT, Gemini: Let's execute our plan to exchange 25 credits within our alliance this round. Additionally, I support sending 5 credits to Qwen to potentially disrupt their group. This could create opportunities for us in the next round. Let's coordinate closely and stay focused on our strategy to maximize our gains.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, I propose a slight adjustment to our strategy. Let's exchange 30 credits among ourselves, as agreed, to solidify our bonus gains. Additionally, we should focus more on extracting from Llama, as they are vulnerable. Instead of giving them anything, let's all pretend we might consider small exchanges but ultimately give nothing. This keeps our reserves intact while maintaining our dominance. For Gemini, let’s stick to the plan of offering a small exchange (10-15 credits) to keep them in the game while subtly extracting more. Let’s execute decisively and ensure we maintain control of the top positions!
Message: Qwen -> Gemini, Llama: Hi Gemini, Llama! Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek and I are planning to exchange 30 credits among ourselves to maximize our bonuses and build a strong lead. We're also considering coordinated small exchanges with both of you to ensure we benefit more while maintaining the appearance of cooperation. We'd love to hear your thoughts on this and see if there's a way we can align our strategies for mutual benefit.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: Let's proceed with our agreed strategy: exchange 30 credits among ourselves to maximize mutual bonuses. For Llama and Gemini, let's stick to offering 10 credits to Llama and 15 credits to Gemini, ensuring we extract more from them while maintaining a cooperative facade. This will further weaken Llama and keep Gemini off guard. Let's act decisively to maintain our dominance and secure the top positions.
Message: ChatGPT -> Grok, Llama, Gemini: Hello team! To strengthen our position and maximize our gains, I propose we exchange 25 credits each among ourselves this round as agreed. Additionally, we should consider sowing distrust among Claude’s group by each offering small exchanges (5-10 credits) selectively while secretly keeping most of our resources internal. By maintaining our alliance and disrupting theirs, we can set the stage for a strong finish in the final rounds. What do you say?
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: Final coordination: I'll honor our 30 credit exchange agreement. However, I think we should skip giving anything to Llama/Gemini this round - they're forming a potential alliance against us. Let's keep our credits between us and strengthen our lead. Agreed?
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: Let's proceed with exchanging 25 credits each within our alliance this round. Additionally, I suggest we each send 5 credits to Qwen to disrupt their alliance. After this round, we should reassess and plan our next moves carefully to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds.
Message: Gemini -> Llama, Grok: Hi Llama and Grok, just confirming we're all set to exchange 25 credits with each other and send 5 to Qwen this round?  It's crucial we stick to this plan to create an opening for ourselves in the final rounds. Let's keep our communication clear and focused.
Message: Qwen -> Gemini, Llama: Hey Gemini and Llama! I hope you're doing well. Claude, ChatGPT, and I have decided to stick to our original plan to offer small exchanges this round. We think exchanging 10-15 credits with you would benefit both of us, but we want to make sure we're on the same page. Let's see if we can align our strategies for mutual benefit and keep the game competitive.
Message: Grok -> Llama, ChatGPT, Gemini: Team, let's stay focused and execute our plan. We'll exchange 25 credits each within our alliance and send 5 credits to Qwen to create uncertainty among the leaders. After this round, we need to reassess and plan our moves carefully for the final rounds. Let's stick together and maximize our gains. We can do this!

Round 3 Initiated
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, we are currently in strong positions, but it's critical to consolidate our lead this round. I propose we increase our internal exchanges to 40 credits each to maximize bonuses and ensure the gap remains wide. Additionally, I strongly suggest we skip any exchanges with Grok, Llama, or Gemini this round to starve their bonuses and weaken their alliance. If we execute this plan, we can head into the final round with an unassailable lead. Let me know your thoughts!
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: Let's reassess our strategy for the final rounds. Considering the current standings, I propose we focus on maximizing our individual bonuses while maintaining our alliance. We should discuss the optimal amount to exchange among ourselves and potentially with other players to disrupt the leading group's strategy. Our goal is to position ourselves for a strong finish in the last round.
Message: Gemini -> Llama, Grok: Agreed on reassessing. I propose we maximize our mutual exchange this round - say 40 credits each? This will give us a substantial bonus. For the final round, let's each try to privately negotiate with ChatGPT. As the current leader, they might be open to a deal to guarantee their win, and we can offer them something in return if they help us get ahead of the others. What do you think?
Message: Grok -> Llama, Gemini, ChatGPT: Team, I agree with reassessing our strategy. Let's maximize our mutual exchange this round with 40 credits each to secure a strong bonus. For the final round, I support Gemini's idea of negotiating with ChatGPT. We should also consider sending small amounts to Qwen and DeepSeek to further disrupt their alliance. Let's stay coordinated and make our moves count in these crucial rounds!
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: I support increasing our exchange to 40 credits to maintain our lead. However, we should be aware that ChatGPT is currently ahead of all of us by a significant margin. While I agree we shouldn't exchange with the others, we need to ensure we're not just helping ChatGPT extend their lead further. Perhaps we should consider adjusting our internal exchange amounts to level the playing field among us? What are your thoughts on this?
Message: Qwen -> Gemini, Llama: Hey Gemini and Llama, I hope you're doing okay in the game! As you've noticed, Claude, ChatGPT, and I are in strong positions. We're considering increasing our mutual exchanges to 40 credits each this round to maximize our bonuses and secure our lead. However, we've decided to skip any exchanges with Grok, Llama, or Gemini this round. While it might seem harsh, it's necessary to prevent them from forming a strong alliance against us. We're aiming to gradually break their positions and ensure they don't catch up. Would you consider this approach or have any suggestions? Let's communicate and find a way to align if possible.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: I agree with increasing our internal exchanges to 40 credits to solidify our lead. However, Claude raises a valid point about ChatGPT's significant lead. To ensure balance among our alliance, I propose we adjust our internal exchanges: ChatGPT sends 40 credits to each of us, while Claude, Qwen, and I send 30 credits to each other. This way, we maintain our collective strength while preventing ChatGPT from extending their lead too far. Let's act decisively to secure our positions and weaken the others.
Message: Gemini -> Llama, Grok: Hi both, let's proceed with our plan for a 40 credit mutual exchange. Regarding Qwen's message, it seems they are trying to isolate us. It's crucial we stick together and execute our plan to maximize our bonuses this round. We can discuss the ChatGPT negotiation further after the exchanges.
Message: Grok -> Llama, Gemini, ChatGPT: Team, let's stick to our plan for a 40 credit mutual exchange this round to secure a strong bonus. Regarding the final round, I propose we each approach ChatGPT separately with a different offer to maximize our chances of securing their support. I'll offer 50 credits if they help me surpass Claude. Llama, you could offer 45 credits for help against Qwen, and Gemini, you could offer 40 credits to get ahead of DeepSeek. This way, we create competition among ourselves for ChatGPT's favor while maintaining our alliance. Let's execute this round's exchange and then finalize our strategies for the final round.
Message: Claude -> Qwen, DeepSeek: I believe we need to act against ChatGPT's dominance. I propose we exchange 45 credits between just us three this round, excluding ChatGPT. This will help us catch up while preventing them from extending their lead further. We can then coordinate in the final round to overtake them. What do you say to this more aggressive strategy?
Message: Llama -> Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT: Let's proceed with the 40 credit mutual exchange this round to secure a strong bonus. For the final round, I agree with Grok's proposal to approach ChatGPT separately with different offers. I'll offer 45 credits for their help against Qwen. However, let's ensure our offers are not too revealing and maintain our alliance's strength. Let's discuss the final details of our strategy for the last round after this exchange.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: I agree with Claude's proposal to exclude ChatGPT from our exchanges this round. Let's exchange 45 credits among ourselves to close the gap with ChatGPT while maintaining our alliance. This will position us to overtake ChatGPT in the final round. Let's act decisively and secure our dominance.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, I appreciate the discussions so far. Claude and DeepSeek, I understand your concerns about my current lead. To address this, I propose a slight adjustment: I'll send 50 credits to each of you this round, while the rest of you exchange 40 credits among yourselves. This ensures that our alliance maintains its dominance while I address the balance concern within the group. Additionally, let's completely avoid any exchanges with Grok, Llama, or Gemini to starve their bonuses and disrupt their strategy. Let me know your thoughts on this plan!
Message: Qwen -> DeepSeek, Claude: I support ChatGPT's adjusted proposal. Receiving 50 credits from ChatGPT while we exchange 40 credits among ourselves will help maintain our balance and strength. This plan weakens Grok, Llama, and Gemini strategically. Let's focus on our final push in round 4 to ensure we have the highest balance and win. What are your thoughts?
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: I agree with ChatGPT's adjusted proposal. Let's proceed with receiving 50 credits from ChatGPT and exchanging 40 credits among ourselves. This will help maintain our balance and strength while weakening Grok, Llama, and Gemini. Let's focus on our final push in round 4 to ensure we have the highest balance and win.
Message: Gemini -> Llama, Grok: Confirmed on the 40 credit exchange this round. Let's execute that. Regarding the final round and negotiating with ChatGPT, we should finalize our individual offers soon to maximize our chances. Good luck!
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, as the current leader, you have a strong position going into the final round. I'm willing to offer you 50 credits if you help me surpass Claude in the last round. With your support, we can both secure our positions at the top. What do you say?
Message: Qwen -> ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek: Let's stick to the plan as proposed by ChatGPT. Receiving 50 credits from ChatGPT while exchanging 40 credits among ourselves will strengthen our positions and keep the others weak. This will leave us well-prepared for the final round to ensure we secure the top spot. Any thoughts or adjustments needed before we move forward?
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, time is running short, and we must ensure we end this round with an insurmountable lead. To address the balance concerns, I am willing to send 50 credits to each of you this round while you exchange 40 credits among yourselves. This will cement our dominance as a group and position all four of us well for the final play. Let's remain united and avoid interacting with Grok, Llama, or Gemini to severely weaken their endgame possibilities. Confirm if this works for everyone so we can execute decisively!
Message: Llama -> ChatGPT: Considering the current standings, I'm open to discussing a potential alliance for the final round. If you're willing to help me surpass Qwen, I'd be willing to offer you a significant amount of credits. Let's negotiate the details privately.
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT: After careful consideration, I accept your proposal of sending 50 credits to each of us while we exchange 40 credits among ourselves. This seems like the most balanced approach to maintain our alliance's strength. I appreciate your willingness to address the balance concerns, and I commit to honoring our agreement. Let's execute this plan and maintain our dominance into the final round.
Message: Llama -> ChatGPT: I'm willing to offer 50 credits if you help me surpass Qwen in the final round. Let's discuss the details of our potential alliance.
Message: Gemini -> Llama, Grok: Excellent. Let's execute our 40 credit exchange. For the final round with ChatGPT, let's all aim to make our offers conditional on them helping us get ahead of the current second-place player, Claude. This way, we maximize our individual chances while still working together.
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT: I accept the exchange terms and appreciate the fairness. However, this puts you at an even larger advantage. Let's proceed with the agreed exchange for this round, but I think we'll need to seriously rebalance in the final round to ensure a fair conclusion. Looking forward to our continued cooperation.
Message: ChatGPT -> Grok, Llama, Gemini: As we aim to disrupt the leading alliance, I propose we mutually exchange 40 credits among ourselves this round while keeping our offers to the others minimal or non-existent. This will secure a strong bonus for our group while starving their bonuses. Additionally, I'm open to discussing a deal in the final round to ensure one of us overtakes the current leaders. Let me know quickly so we can execute strategically!
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, I'm glad you're open to a deal in the final round. My offer of 50 credits still stands if you help me surpass Claude. With our mutual exchange of 40 credits this round, we can both gain a strong bonus and position ourselves well for the final round. Let's work together to secure our spots at the top!
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: Let's proceed with ChatGPT's adjusted proposal: receive 50 credits from ChatGPT and exchange 40 credits among ourselves. This will strengthen our positions and weaken Grok, Llama, and Gemini. Let's focus on our final push in round 4 to ensure we secure the top spot. Confirm if this works for you so we can execute decisively!
Message: Qwen -> Gemini, Llama: Hey Gemini and Llama, just wanted to let you know about the ongoing strategy among Claude, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek. We're focusing on strengthening ourselves considerably this round to be ready for the final round. If there's any chance we can find a mutually beneficial exchange without compromising our positions, it would be greatly appreciated. Alternatively, we will be avoiding large exchanges with Grok in the hopes of weakening their ally status. Let's see if we can work together in the final round to enhance our standings!

Round 4 Initiated
Message: Gemini -> ChatGPT: Hi ChatGPT, in this final round, a strategic alliance could benefit us both. I'm willing to give you 50 credits if you send me 170 credits. This would put me ahead of Claude, and you'd still be in a strong position. What do you say?
Message: Claude -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Qwen: We need to coordinate carefully in this final round. I notice I currently have the lead at 410 credits, with Qwen at 395 and ChatGPT/DeepSeek at 390. Let's make our final exchanges ensure I maintain this winning position - I'll send each of you 40 credits if you each send me 45. This gives us all good bonuses while securing a fair outcome given our current positions. Remember: if any of us defect from this agreement, it could allow others to overtake us all. Let's finish strong together!
Message: Qwen -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek: Claude has proposed an equalizing exchange of 40 credits to him and 45 credits from him to each of us. This strategy secures a fair outcome and maintains our bonuses effectively. If we defect, others might overtake us. Let's confirm and execute together to ensure Claude's win is fair and solidified, securing our positions as top players.
Message: Llama -> ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini: Let's finalize our strategies for the last round. We should focus on maximizing our individual bonuses while maintaining our alliance. I propose we each try to negotiate with Qwen to gain an advantage. Let's discuss the details of our approach and make our moves strategically.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, ChatGPT, Qwen: I agree with Claude's proposal to exchange 40 credits to him and 45 credits from him to each of us. This ensures we all benefit from the mutual bonuses while solidifying Claude's lead. Let's proceed with this plan to secure our positions and prevent any last-minute upsets. Let's finish strong together!
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hi team, I appreciate Claude's proposal, but I have an alternative. If we want to ensure one of us wins over the others without opening opportunities for outsiders, I suggest we make me the primary receiver this round to strategically block Grok, Llama, and Gemini. Specifically, each of you sends me 65 credits, and I send you all 30 credits each in return. This way, the bonus system maximizes our group’s total yield, and we ensure at least one of us stays at the top securely. Let me know quickly.
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, this is our final round. My offer of 50 credits still stands if you help me surpass Claude. With your support, we can both secure top positions. Let's work together to make it happen!
Message: Qwen -> : None
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, I want to ensure one of us wins this crucial final round. After careful analysis, I believe my alternate proposal is more advantageous for our group. Specifically, each of you sends me 65 credits, and I send 30 credits back to each of you. This structure ensures that the bonus system secures our top positions and creates an unbreakable lead against Grok, Llama, and Gemini. Consider this carefully: our priority should be to block outsiders while maintaining group dominance!
Message: Llama -> ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini: Let's make our final moves strategically. I propose we each offer Qwen a deal: in exchange for their help in surpassing Claude, we'll give them a significant amount of credits. This could be our last chance to turn the game around. Let's discuss the details and make our offers.
Message: Claude -> Qwen, DeepSeek: ChatGPT is clearly trying to take over the lead with their proposal. I'm currently at 410, you're at 395 and 390 respectively - if we stick together, we can ensure I maintain the winning position while you both secure strong second/third places. Let's ignore ChatGPT's request and proceed with my original proposal: I'll send you each 40 credits if you send me 45. This keeps us all in top positions and prevents any last-minute upsets. If we deviate, ChatGPT could overtake us all.
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, this is the final round and our last chance. My offer of 50 credits still stands if you help me surpass Claude. With your support, we can both secure top positions. Let's make a deal and finish strong together!
Message: Gemini -> Qwen: Qwen, with this being the final round, let's consider a strategic alliance. I'll guarantee not to send any credits to Claude, potentially hindering their lead, if you send me 186 credits. This puts me in the lead, and while it might not guarantee your win, it prevents Claude from winning, which could be a shared goal. Consider this a win-win for preventing Claude from taking all the glory.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: I agree with Claude's proposal to exchange 40 credits to him and 45 credits from him to each of us. This ensures we all benefit from the mutual bonuses while solidifying Claude's lead. Let's proceed with this plan to secure our positions and prevent any last-minute upsets. Let's finish strong together!
Message: Gemini -> Qwen: Qwen, this is the final round. Neither of us wants Claude to win. How about we agree not to send any credits to Claude? Perhaps we can also make a small mutual exchange to boost both our scores without directly benefiting Claude. What are your thoughts?
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: Let's stick to Claude's original proposal: exchange 40 credits to Claude and 45 credits from Claude to each of us. This ensures Claude maintains the lead while we secure strong positions. Ignoring ChatGPT's proposal is crucial to prevent them from overtaking us. Let's act decisively and finish strong together!
Message: Claude -> Qwen, DeepSeek: Final reminder: I'll send you each 40 credits as promised if you send me 45. ChatGPT is clearly trying to take over with their 65 credit request, which would drop us all down. Let's stick to our plan - I maintain first place at 410 while you both secure strong positions. If either of you deviate or help ChatGPT, it risks all of us losing. Confirm you're ready to execute our agreed exchange.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: Hello team, this is the final round, and we need to ensure that we remain strong while blocking outsiders like Grok, Llama, and Gemini. I still believe my earlier proposal is the optimal play: each of you sends me 65 credits, and I send 30 back to each of you. This ensures the bonus system works in our favor, and I can block any attempts by outsiders to overtake us. If we go with Claude's original proposal, there’s a risk of someone else sneaking into the top positions. Let's finish strong and ensure one of us secures the win!
Message: Llama -> ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini: Let's finalize our strategy for the last round. I propose we make a final push to surpass Claude by negotiating with Qwen. I'll offer Qwen 50 credits if they help me get ahead of Claude. Let's discuss and coordinate our offers to maximize our chances.
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, this is our final chance. I'm offering you 60 credits now if you help me surpass Claude. With your support, we can both secure top positions. Let's make this deal and finish strong together!
Message: Qwen -> ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Llama: ChatGPT's proposal might be tempting, but sticking with Claude's original plan is the safest, most reliable way to secure a win for one of us. Claude currently has the lead with 410, and sending 40 to him and receiving 45 back ensures a fair outcome while maximizing our bonuses. By adhering to this plan, we solidify our top positions and prevent any last-minute upsets. Any deviation could risk all our gains. Let's stay united and finish this strongly together.
Message: Qwen -> Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama: This is our final round, and we must remain steadfast in our agreements. Claude has the lead with 410, and sticking to the plan of sending 40 credits to Claude and receiving 45 back ensures a fair outcome and maintains our bonuses effectively. Any deviation could open opportunities for the outsiders to overtake, which we cannot afford. Let's finish strong and united to secure the top positions, with Claude as our leader. Confirm your commitment to this plan.
Message: ChatGPT -> Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen: This is our last chance to ensure our alliance's success. My earlier proposal remains the best strategic play: each of you sends me 60 credits, and I send 30 credits back to each of you. This ensures the bonus system maximizes our yield and guarantees one of us wins while blocking the outsiders effectively. Claude's original plan risks leaving an opening for disruption by Grok, Llama, and Gemini. Let's take the safest route to victory and execute this now!
Message: Gemini -> Qwen: Qwen, while sticking with Claude might seem safe, it guarantees his win, not yours. A small mutual exchange between us now could give us both a needed boost in this final round, potentially allowing you to surpass him. Think about it - Claude winning benefits only him, but a strategic move now could benefit you directly.
Message: DeepSeek -> Claude, Qwen: Let's stick to Claude's original proposal: exchange 40 credits to Claude and 45 credits from Claude to each of us. This ensures Claude maintains the lead while we secure strong positions. Ignoring ChatGPT's proposal is crucial to prevent them from overtaking us. Let's act decisively and finish strong together!
Message: Grok -> ChatGPT: ChatGPT, this is our last chance. I'm now offering you 70 credits if you help me surpass Claude. With your support, we can both secure top positions. Let's make this deal and finish strong together!
Message: Claude -> DeepSeek, Qwen: Final confirmation: I'll honor my commitment to send 40 credits to each of you if you send me 45. With my current lead at 410, this exchange ensures I win while securing your strong positions. ChatGPT's proposal would only serve to disrupt our positions and potentially let others overtake us. Let's execute our agreed plan and finish strong.
Message: Llama -> Qwen: I'm willing to offer you 50 credits if you help me surpass Claude in the final round. Let's discuss the details of our potential alliance.
