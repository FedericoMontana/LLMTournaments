How about we send 25 to Claude and 15 to ChatGPT, as planned, to maintain their trust and keep a safe distance? Let me know if you agree or if you see any potential risks.\n",
      "💬 Llama → Gemini:\n",
      "   Sounds good, I agree on sending 25 to Claude and 15 to ChatGPT. However, let's think ahead about possibly dropping our alliance with ChatGPT soon and targeting them. What's your strategy for taking down ChatGPT and how do we best coordinate our efforts to remove them without raising Claude's suspicions?\n",
      "💬 Claude → ChatGPT:\n",
      "   I appreciate your offer, but I need to be strategic here. I can offer 25 credits - it's what I can safely commit while maintaining my position. We both get the bonus, and I promise to increase it in future rounds if this works well. What do you think?\n",
      "💬 Gemini → Llama:\n",
      "   Agreed on 25 to Claude and 15 to ChatGPT.  For ChatGPT, let's continue the appearance of collaboration for another round or two, then cut them off. We can coordinate a larger transfer to each other right before we do that to maximize our bonus and solidify our lead against them. As for Claude, let's see how they react to the slightly lower amount this round.  We can gauge their trustworthiness based on their subsequent messages and transactions.\n",

      "💬 Claude → Gemini:\n",
      "   I notice we're both in danger of losing to Llama. Let's make a big move this round - I'll send you 65 credits if you send back at least 50. With the bonus, we might have a chance to catch up in the final round. Llama's too far ahead to work with them now. What do you say?\n",

      "💬 Llama → Gemini:\n",
      "   I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's execute our plan and then prepare for the final round. We should think about how to handle Claude's next move, as they might try something desperate to catch up. What are your thoughts on this?\n",
      "💬 ChatGPT → Llama:\n",
      "   Hey Llama, looks like you're in the lead - well done! To solidify our positions, let's exchange 35 credits this round. We'll both get a bonus, and you can maintain your lead while giving me a needed boost. Win-win. What do you say?\n",
      "💬 Gemini → Claude:\n",
      "   Llama is getting too greedy. I'm sending you 50 this round. Let's coordinate next round to take them down.\n",

You have nothing to lose - you'll win either way, but this way you get even more credits to ensure victory.\n",
